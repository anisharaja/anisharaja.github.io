    "On the left side of the dashboard, there is a plot describing the relationship between the 2019 Public School CCRPI score and the average annual salary of Pre-K to Grade 12 teachers in various counties in the state of Georgia. Also on the left side, if one hovers over a circle, then there will be information about the county, the 2019 Public School CCRPI score and the average annual salary of Pre-K to Grade 12 teachers corresponding to that circle. On the right side of the dashboard, there is a chart illustrating a comparison between the average annual salaries of Administrators, Support Staff, and Pre-K to Grade 12 teachers in a particular county. Also on the right side, if one hovers over the bar, then the average annual salary associated with that bar will be displayed. The county that is illustrated on the right is based on the circle that is selected on the left. For example, if the county selected on the left is Jenkins county, then the average annual salaries of Administrators, Support Staff, and Pre-K to Grade 12 teachers of Jenkins county will be displayed on the right. If none of the circles are selected, then the labels for all of the counties will show. Once a county is selected, the dashboard should reset itself and show the data it is supposed to show. \n",
